## Task list

```markdown
1. [x] Write the press release
2. [ ] Update the website
3. [ ] Contact the media
```

## Footnotes

Here is a footnote reference,[^1] and another.[^longnote]

[^1]: Here is the footnote.

[^longnote]: Hereâ€™s one with multiple blocks.

    Subsequent paragraphs are indented to show that they
belong to the previous footnote.

        { some.code }

    The whole paragraph can be indented, or just the first
    line. In this way, multi-paragraph footnotes[^sub] work like
    multi-paragraph list items.

[^sub]: Footnotes can have footnotes, too.

This paragraph won't be part of the note, because it isn't indented.

## Definition lists

Term 1
: Definition 1
with lazy continuation.

Term 2 with *inline markup*
: Definition 2

        { some code, part of Definition 2 }

: Third paragraph of definition 2.

## Abbreviations

This is HTML abbreviation example.

It converts "HTML", but keep intact partial entries like "xxxHTMLyyy" and so on.

*[HTML]: Hyper Text Markup Language
